Beak after razor-sharp beak pecked at her head and slashed her arms as she tried to protect herself. Blood was running down her face into her eyes and she could no longer see.

I'd booked and embarked a fairly bog standard 2 week sailing holiday touring the Greek Islands during the summer months last year. There was myself and 5 other guests on the boat together with the captain and two other crew members responsible for the day to day running of the boat and keeping their paying passengers happy. All was proceeding as planned and we'd already enjoyed some leisurely sailing initially setting sail from Athens and touring the Greek mainland coast two days and two nights before heading into more adventurous waters. The plan was to head toward Santorini and we were well on our way until the fourth night of the trip where we encountered the most amazing an colourful storm the like of which I have never seen before. As we were engulfed by the storm the boat was lifted out of the water and we found ourselves bashed and buffeted towards an island which worryingly the captain informed us did not appear on any maps and to make matters worse the storm had made out boat no longer seaworthy and knocked out all of our communications and navigation equipment. We set up camp on the island as best we could with what we could extract from our damaged boat but what was even stranger we were not alone on the island - it would appear that we were sharing the island with a colony of 6 foot tall chickens. So we're still there now three months later but things have not been too bad with a plentiful supply of massive eggs but I'm afraid we're all starting to get very sick of the meals consisting of mainly omelette and scrambled eggs to the quicker you can rescue us from where we've ended up as a result of our open seas adventure I'd be extremely grateful! ,1903,d0a5d8c4-a5d8-42e4-9e98-657545cec815,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,38,,0.0,,50,9,6,4,5,6,1,1,,,,,,,6,3,5,4,6,3,"[""tt_boring"", ""tt_funny"", ""tt_badly_written"", ""tt_future"", ""tt_twist"", ""tt_enjoyed""]",1,1,38,,0.0,0,95,,,,,,,,I provided it myself under the guidance from the task required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,38,,0.0,3,3,7,2,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,Male,,58,Undergraduate degree,Employed full time,IT Development Manager,"£50,000-£74,999",Interesting study and I hope my story is OK!,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using recently developed, novel space drive systems that exploit the fabric of the universe to traverse wormholes almost instantaneously, thousands of explorers have been sent to search for likely new planets that humans could use as new homes.    Likely destinations have been identified using the results of work carried out by SETI, that catalogued many sources of extra-terrestrial signals, combined with data sent back from the Hubble and James Webb deep space telescopes.     Scientists have used all this to create a long list of destinations to explore.    Even using the space-drive breakthroughs, this work is likely to take decades, before anything is selected as  likely to be suitable, as the work involved at each of the sites will take years.    This work has come about only because the major economic powers of the world have finally agreed to work co-operatively, rather than in their individual national interests.    The world's dwindling population looks on in bewilderment and anger, as it struggles to survive on rationed resources and in worsening conditions.

When he was young all he did was draw pictures of spaceships and dream about traveling into space and landing on a new planet.  James didn't know how he would get into space as he didn't have a spaceship nor could he fly a spaceship.    Every night before bed James would pray to the heavens for a space ship to take him to a new planet.  This went on for many years and still no spaceship would be there in the morning when he woke up or when he came home from school.  Then one day out of the blue James woke up and he heard a rumble, He ran down stairs and to his amazement, There it was a great big blue spaceship. He couldn't believe his eyes.    Within 30 minutes James was packed up and ready to go he said goodbye to his family  and pressed the big red button that said ""launch"" After some time he arrived on his new planet, He loved it so much that he decided to stay there forever.
